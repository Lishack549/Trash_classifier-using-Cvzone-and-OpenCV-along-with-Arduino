# Trash_classifier-using-Cvzone-and-OpenCV-along-with-Arduino
This project is a computer vision-based waste classification system that uses a camera to classify different types of waste and directs them to appropriate bins. The system leverages cvzone, OpenCV, and an Arduino for image processing, classification, and hardware control.
